> Every ecosystem has its own dependency manager, but **no tool looks across C++, Android, iOS, C#/.NET, and Web to tell you: how much code is actually yours, what's third-party, and what's dead weight.**
>
> **repo-scan** gives you the answer — a cross-stack source code asset audit that classifies every file, identifies every dependency, and delivers an actionable verdict for each module. One command, zero dependencies, interactive HTML report.

## The Problem

You're staring at a monorepo with 200+ directories, 50,000 files, multiple tech stacks, and third-party code mixed into source folders. Before you can refactor, merge, or make any architectural decision, you need answers:

- Which modules are **core assets** worth investing in?
- Which are **duplicate wheels** that should be merged?
- Which haven't been touched in **3 years** and should be retired?
- Where are the **hidden third-party libs** with no version tracking?

Running `cloc` gives you line counts. Running dependency scanners gives you one stack at a time. **repo-scan gives you the full picture — across all stacks, in one pass.**

## What Sets It Apart

| | Traditional tools | repo-scan |
|---|---|---|
| **Scope** | Single language/ecosystem | C/C++, Java/Android, iOS, C#/.NET, Web — unified |
| **Third-party detection** | Declared deps only | Source-embedded libs too (50+ known libraries) |
| **Output** | Raw metrics | Actionable 4-level verdicts per module |
| **Monorepo** | Flat file list | Hierarchical scan with drill-down HTML |
| **AI-native** | N/A | Designed as Agent Skill with token-efficient analysis |

## Core Capabilities

- **Cross-stack unified view** — C/C++, Java/Android, iOS (OC/Swift), C#/.NET, Web (TS/JS/Vue) in a single report
- **Three-way file classification** — Project code / third-party / build artifacts with accurate size metrics
- **Third-party detection** — Auto-identifies 50+ libraries (FFmpeg, Boost, OpenSSL...) with version extraction from headers, configs, and package files
- **Four-level verdicts** — Every module gets a decision: **Core Asset** / **Extract & Merge** / **Rebuild** / **Deprecate**
- **Cross-module review** — Second-pass analysis finds capability overlaps, dependency topology, verdict corrections, and refactoring priorities
- **Interactive HTML reports** — Dark-theme local pages; monorepo mode generates `index.html` with clickable project cards and verdict distribution bars
- **Incremental deep analysis** — `deep` mode adds thread safety, memory management, error handling, and API consistency checks on top of standard data
- **Hierarchical scanning** — Large monorepos auto-split into summary + sub-project reports, keeping AI context manageable
- **Code duplication detection** — Finds same-name directories across the project, auto-excludes third-party false positives
- **Git activity analysis** — Discovers all sub-repos with commit history (which modules haven't been touched in 2 years?)
- **AI token efficiency** — Three-layer strategy: filename inference → key file reading → quality sampling (no exhaustive reading)

## Analysis Depth Levels

| Level | Files Read (per module) | Quality Checks | Use Case |
|-------|------------------------|----------------|----------|
| `fast` | 1-2: build config + one key header | Dependency versions only | Quick inventory of huge directories (hundreds of modules) |
| `standard` | 2-5: headers + entry files + build config | Full: deps, architecture, tech debt | Default audit |
| `deep` | 5-10: adds core implementation, tests, CI | Thread safety, memory, error handling, API consistency | Incremental on top of standard data |
| `full` | All files in module | Full analysis + cross-file comparison | Pre-merge comprehensive review |

**Deep mode is incremental** — it detects existing scan data, auto-selects high-value modules (Core Asset + Extract & Merge), and appends detailed analysis:

```
/repo-scan /path/to/project --level deep                          # auto-select modules
/repo-scan /path/to/project --level deep --modules base,rtmp_sdk  # specific modules
```

**`--gap-check` — Incremental capability gap detection** — after a scan is complete, compare your consolidated module library against candidate source directories to find missed symbols, API differences, and implementation improvements:

```
/repo-scan --gap-check
/repo-scan --gap-check -m base
```

Copy `config/gap-config-example.json` to `gap-config.json` and fill in your local paths before running. Outputs a Markdown report with `[MANDATORY-IMPORT]`, `[MANDATORY-EVAL]`, and `[EVAL-IMPL]` tagged items.

## Output Sections

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Architecture Tree** | Physical directory structure, semantically compressed, third-party and dead code color-coded |
| **Module Descriptions** | Function, core classes, dependencies, third-party refs (with version assessment), quality, verdict |
| **Asset Triage Table** | Global summary: **Core Asset** / **Extract & Merge** / **Rebuild** / **Deprecate** |
| **Cross-Module Review** | Capability overlap map, dependency topology, verdict corrections, refactoring priorities |
| **Deep Analysis** | Per-file review, thread safety, memory, error handling, API consistency (purple DEEP badge) |

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Global skills directory
git clone https://github.com/haibindev/repo-scan.git ~/.claude/skills/repo-scan

# Or project-level
git clone https://github.com/haibindev/repo-scan.git .claude/skills/repo-scan
```

### As an Agent Skill

```
/repo-scan /path/to/my-project
/repo-scan /path/to/my-project --level fast
/repo-scan /path/to/my-project --level deep
/repo-scan /path/to/my-project --level deep --modules base,encoder
```

### Standalone Pre-scan

The pre-scan script (Python 3, zero deps) generates structured Markdown data for AI analysis:

```bash
python scripts/pre-scan.py /path/to/project                    # stdout
python scripts/pre-scan.py /path/to/project -o report.md       # single file
python scripts/pre-scan.py /path/to/project -d ./scan-output   # hierarchical (recommended)
python scripts/pre-scan.py /path/to/project -c config.json     # custom config
```
